# Future Plans

Convert this project to Rust?

Convert this project to Javascript and run it in the browser?

Maybe, instead of encoding quartets, we use a queue of 4 characters, so that the last char has been encoded 4 times

## User Interface

Make a UI that looks like an Enigma machine in a box
* Instead of a keyboard, but a text field
  * Maybe: Show a keyboard with a key for every symbol in the cuboids 
* Instead of a lamp board, but a mock LCD Screen with a copy button
* Instead of Rotors, visualize cuboids with symbols
* Instead of a Plugboard, put 4 sliders (x, y, z, & num_rotors)
* Put the key phrase input above the rotors
* After encoding a phrase, encourage the user to re-encode the phrase again
